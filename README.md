# Managed to Unmanaged
SQL script to convert a managed to unmanaged solution in an on-premises Dynamics CRM/365 database.

This is described in detail here:
https://community.dynamics.com/crm/b/magnetismsolutionscrmblog/archive/2012/10/02/managed-to-unmanaged-kids-don-t-try-this-at-home

This is meant only as a last resort when trying to recover an unmanaged solution from a managed solution.  Use at your own risk.  This is not my script, but the script reference in blog post above (where download link no longer exists).
